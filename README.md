im shrihari R, this is a project created by me for round 2 radicalStart interview , this project is a student management dashboard its's contains functionality such as CRUD operation and search operation.
i used Mysql Express.js React.ja Node.js in this project and also i used Sequelize, it is a popular Node.js ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) library for relational databases. It provides a convenient way to interact with databases using JavaScript objects, abstracting the SQL queries and allowing developers to work with models and associations. 
Note i used mysql workbench for this ,unlike php myadmin mysql it contains a unique portnumber to communicate with node js .
i used mostly useReducer instead of useState , and redux thunk instead of just calling the axios inside use effect becuase of better app performance and optmization
